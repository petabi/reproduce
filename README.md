# REproduce

REproduce monitors a log file or a directory of log files, and sends appended
entries to a Kafka server. Each message to Kafka is assigned an event ID
consisting of system time in seconds (32 bits), sequence number (24 bits), and
data source ID (8 bits).

## Build

REproduce may be built as a single binary for portability. Make sure that the
musl target is available. The following command installs the Rust compiler for
`x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` if it is not already installed:

```sh
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
```

Then the portable REproduce binary, `reproduce`, can be created with the
following command:

```sh
cargo build --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl --release
```

The compiled binary will be created in
`target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release`.

## Usage

To diplay the usage, type:

```sh
reproduce -h
```

## Examples

* Convert a log file and send it to the kafka server:
    ```sh
    reproduce -i LOG_20180906 -b 192.168.10.1:9092 -t sample_topic
    ```
* Send all log files whose names starting with `msg` in the `/data/LOG`
  directory recursively:
    ```sh
    reproduce -i /data/LOG -n msg -b 192.168.4.5:9092 -t syslog -e
    ```
* Send all log files in the `/data/LOG` directory recursively. The directory
  will be polled periodically (every 3 seconds by default). A new file will be
  sent as well.
    ```sh
    reproduce -i /data/LOG -v -b 192.168.4.5:9092 -t syslog -e
    ```
